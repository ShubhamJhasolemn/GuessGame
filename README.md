# GuessGame
This is a basic no. guess game using Java in which a random number is generated by the computer and we have to guess the number . If the guessed number is correct the computer will give the output "you guessed the number" otherwise it will predict that the guessed no. is high or low.Hope you will enjoy the game!!
